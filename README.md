# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-for-House-prices

This project demonstrates the process of performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a house prices dataset. The goal is to uncover patterns, detect anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions using summary statistics and graphical representations.

Project Overview:

Understanding the factors that affect house prices is crucial for making informed decisions in real estate investment, urban planning, and policy making. This project uses a dataset containing various features of houses and their respective sale prices. The EDA process includes data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis to extract meaningful insights.

Introduction:

Provides a brief overview of the dataset and objectives of the analysis.
Data Loading and Cleaning:

Loads the dataset using Pandas.
Handles missing values and outliers.
Performs data transformation and normalization.
Descriptive Statistics:

Calculates summary statistics for numerical features.
Displays frequency distribution for categorical features.
Data Visualization:

Utilizes various plots to visualize relationships and distributions:
Histograms and box plots for numerical features.
Scatter plots to explore relationships with the target variable.
Correlation heatmap to identify multicollinearity among features.
Feature Engineering:

Creates new features from existing ones to enhance predictive power.
Encodes categorical variables for modeling purposes.
Hypothesis Testing:

Applies statistical tests to validate assumptions and hypotheses.
Conclusions:

Summarizes key findings and insights derived from the analysis.
Data:

Refers to the dataset used, typically sourced from platforms like Kaggle (e.g., House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques).
Dependencies:

Lists the Python libraries required for the project:
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scipy
Scikit-learn
Installation:

Provides instructions to install the necessary dependencies using pip.
Jupyter Notebook Content:

Outlines the organization of the notebook into sections, guiding the user through each step of the EDA process.
