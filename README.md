# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-for-House-prices

This project demonstrates the process of performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a house prices dataset. The goal is to uncover patterns, detect anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions using summary statistics and graphical representations.

Project Overview
Understanding the factors that affect house prices is crucial for making informed decisions in real estate investment, urban planning, and policy making. This project uses a dataset containing various features of houses and their respective sale prices. The EDA process includes data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis to extract meaningful insights.

Features
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and transforming variables.
Descriptive Statistics: Summary statistics for numerical and categorical variables.
Visualizations: Various plots to visualize relationships and distributions.
Histograms
Box plots
Scatter plots
Correlation heatmap
Feature Engineering: Creating new features from existing ones to enhance predictive power.
Hypothesis Testing: Statistical tests to validate assumptions and hypotheses.
Dependencies
Python 3.x
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scipy
Scikit-learn
Installation
To install the necessary dependencies, run:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy scikit-learn
Usage
